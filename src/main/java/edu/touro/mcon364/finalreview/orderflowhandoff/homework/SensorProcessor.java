/**
 * Homework 2 — Sensor reading processor.
 *
 * A monitoring system receives readings from sensors over time. One part of the
 * program submits readings as they arrive. Another part of the program
 * processes
 * those readings using one or more background workers.
 *
 * This class is responsible for coordinating that handoff and for keeping a
 * summary of the readings that were actually processed.
 *
 * The important question is not only "How do we calculate the stats?" It is
 * also:
 * "What happens when readings are being submitted and processed by different
 * threads at the same time?"
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - submit(reading) accepts one new sensor reading for later processing.
 * - start(workerCount) starts workerCount background workers.
 * - workerCount must be greater than 0.
 * - Workers should process submitted readings until the processor is stopped
 * and
 * all already-submitted readings have been handled.
 * - stop() tells the processor to stop accepting/processing future work and
 * waits
 * until the workers finish the remaining work.
 * - getTotalProcessed() returns how many readings have been processed so far.
 * - getStats() returns summary statistics for the processed reading values:
 * count, minimum, maximum, sum, and average.
 * - Public reporting methods must not expose mutable internal state.
 *
 * Before coding, think about:
 * - Which object or objects represent work waiting to be processed?
 * - Which object or objects represent work that has already been processed?
 * - Which state can be accessed by more than one thread?
 * - How will workers know when to keep working and when to stop?
 * - What should happen if getStats() is called while workers are still running?
 * - Is it better to store all processed readings and calculate stats later, or
 * update numeric summary state as each reading is processed?
 * - If several workers update the same stats, how will those updates stay
 * correct?
